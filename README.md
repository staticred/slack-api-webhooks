# slack-api-webhooks
These are sample code for incoming and outgoing webhooks. 

##incoming_webhook.php##
This is the start of a possible Mahara Slack integration, which notifies a channel when a new portfolio is submitted. The webhook provides a title, link to the portfolio, and information about the submission.

##outgoing_webhook.php##
This is a goofy little outgoing webhook, which replies whenever someone complains about Giphy.  It triggers on 'giphy sucks' or 'dammit giphy' and replies with a cheeky little message.
